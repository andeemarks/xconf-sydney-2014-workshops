# Collect number of processes, grouped by their state (e. g. running, sleeping, zombies, etc.)
# if no process name given.

# For selected processes, grouped by name, it collects:
#
# processes Resident Segment Size 
# (RSS; basically the amount of physical memory currently used by these processes)
# Used user- and system-time (the "CPU usage")
# The number of processes by that name
# The number of threads (summed up over all the processes)
# The number of major and minor page faults.
# Rough I/O-numbers (bytes written and read due to syscalls by the process).
